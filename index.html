<p>
My name is Casey Falk and I am a Computer Science Major at Haverford College. I love solving problems in clever, innovative ways and learning about algorithms, implementation, and design. I am always on the lookout for a new, interesting project and I would love to hear from you!

Outside of the computer world, I play tenor saxophone, didgeridoo, and 5-string banjo. When I am back home in Idaho and the weather permits it, I enjoy looking at the stars. The earth is a magnificent place to live; there is so much beauty and so much to learn -- and a remarkable amount of overlap between the two.
