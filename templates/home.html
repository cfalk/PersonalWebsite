My name is Casey Falk and I am a Computer Science Major ('16) at Haverford College. I love solving problems in clever, innovative ways and learning about algorithms, implementation, and design. I am always on the lookout to help make people's lives better and easier -- and if you have an idea I'd love to help you make it a reality!

Outside of the computer world, I play tenor saxophone, didgeridoo, and 5-string banjo (and a bit of clarinet, though I'm rusty). When I am back home in Idaho and the weather permits it, I enjoy looking at the stars. Really, I enjoy exploring and learning about the world.
